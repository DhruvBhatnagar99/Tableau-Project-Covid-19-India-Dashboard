### Project Overview:
This Tableau project focuses on visualizing COVID-19 data in India. The dashboard offers:

1. Insights into the spread, trends, and impact of the virus across regions and timeframes.
2. Visualizations showcasing regional variations and demographics.
   
By leveraging Tableau's capabilities, this project provides an informative and intuitive platform for understanding the COVID-19 situation in India. It demonstrates my commitment to using data visualization for greater awareness during these challenging times.
